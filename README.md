# Ruby on Rails Bundle for Vim

Vim as a Ruby on Rails IDE with all the cool plugins and nifty configuration.
Follow the simple installation guide and hack in no time! 

**Note**: We replaced old submodule architecture for bundles with neat [Vundle](https://github.com/gmarik/Vundle.vim), so
  there's no need to install submodules with Git anymore. We also ditched [Vim Powerline](https://github.com/Lokaltog/vim-powerline) in favor
  of [Vim Airline](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline). If you have any problems with fonts and rendering of statusline, please, refer to the [documentation of Vim Airline](https://github.com/bling/vim-airline/wiki/FAQ) first.

## Installation

### Requirements

* **Vim/Gvim**
* **Ruby, Rails, Bundler** ([rvm](https://rvm.io/rvm/install/) ftw!)
* **Git**

There are some core stuff that other plugin use. In order to make them work, you need to have
these packages installed:

* **Curl, xclip** for [Gist.vim](https://github.com/vim-scripts/Gist.vim)
* **Ack** for [Ack.vim](https://github.com/mileszs/ack.vim)
* **Clang** for [clang_complete.vim](https://github.com/Rip-Rip/clang_complete)

To satisfy requirements, run (Ubuntu only):
```
sudo apt-get install vim vim-gtk git curl ack-grep clang xclip
```
For other distros or package managers, refer to package management documentation.

## Setup

Clone the repository:
```
git clone git://github.com/smolnar/vim-rails-bundle.git .vim-rails-bundle
cd .vim-rails-bundle

# For Vundle
git submodule init
git submodule update
```

Install necessary gems:
```
bundle install
```

Install plugins by Vundle
```
vim +PluginInstall +qall
```

Choose what you want to install:

* **rake bundle:config** symlinks `.vim` and `.vimrc` to your `$HOME` or other path if specified in `config.yml` and install Vundle bundles automatically.
* **rake bundle:gtk** symlinks `.gtkrc-2.0-vim` in your `$HOME` or or other path if specified in `config.yml`. In order to autoload this file, it appends
`include "...../.gtkrc-2.0-vim"` to your `.gtkrc-2.0`.
* **rake bundle:desktop** symlinks `gvim_for_rails.desktop` file in `/usr/share/applications` and `gvim_for_rails` script in `/usr/bin`. Note, that `sudo` is required.

Now, run `vim`, `gvim_for_rails` or open `Gvim for Rails` and start hackin'!

If something isn't woking for you, create [an issue](https://github.com/smolnar/vim-rails-bundle/issues).

## Configuration

### Keyboard

This bundle is shipped with some default keyboard mappings defined in `.vimrc`. Fell free to change them. I try to use as many comments as possible, but if you're not confident what the options does, refer to exhaustive [vim documantation](http://vimdoc.sourceforge.net/htmldoc/usr_toc.html).


If you like trailing characters (`▸`,`¬`,`❯`,`❮`), you can easy set it up by uncommenting the following lines:
```
set list
set listchars...
```
in `.vimrc`.

`Leader` is a key defined in `let mapleader=...`. Bundle uses `,` as `Leader` by default.
Note, that when pressing any `Leader` combo, you don't need to press all buttons at once, it's a sequence. 

| Keys          | Action        |
| ------------- |:-------------:|
| `Space` | Open all folds. |
| `CTRL` + `a`| Go Home (at the beginning of a line. Emacs-like helper.)|
| `CTRL` + `e`| Go to End (at the end of a line. Emacs-like helper.)|
| `CTRL` + `s`| Save current file. (Works in Gvim out of the box. For terminal, set mapping of Ctrl - s.)|
| `Leader` + `q` | Quit current buffer (If there is only one tab or buffer, it quits the vim as well!) | 
| `CTRL` + `ALT` + `q`| Quit current buffer or file (It does not quit the window, but creates empty buffer instead). |
| `CTRL` + `ALT` + `w` | Write and quit. |
| `Leader` + `Space`| Get rid of all search highlights. |
| `Leader` + `s` + `h`| Toggle highlight of search results. |

| `Leader` + `t`| Run [ctags](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ctags) silently. |
| `Leader` + `p`| Paste from clipboard.|
| `Leader` + `y`| Copy to clipboard. |
| `Leader` + `a`| Run [Ack](http://betterthangrep.com/) search. (Search in current dir (CWD) for specified parrtern.) |
| `Leader` + `=`| Format whole file. |
| `CTRL` + `n` or `CTRL` + `t` | Open new tab. |
| `CTRL` + `ALT` + `n`| Open new tab with the content of current text file. |
| `ALT` + `Left`| Previous tab. |
| `ALT` + `Right` | Next tab. |
| `ALT` + *n* | Move to *n*-th tab, where n is from 0..9. |
| `Leader` + `u` | Uppercase all letters of current word. |
| `Leader` + `l` | Lowercase all letters of current word. |
| `Leader` + `w` + `u`| Uppercase first letter of current word.|
| `Leader` + `w` + `l`| Lowercases first letter of current word.|
| `Leader` + `c` + `d`| Change directory to the directory containing the file in the buffer.|
| `Leader` + `g` + `w`| Swap two words. |

### UI 

Gvim uses gtk fixes in `.gtkrc-2.0-vim` to set colors of gtk backround and tabs. Adjust these values as you like. 
Default theme is `Monokai` colorscheme port from Textmate. If you want Monaco font (Textmate Monospaced font), follow [this guide](https://gist.github.com/epegzz/1634235) and then
change font in `.vimrc` like this

```
set guifont=Monaco\ for\ Powerline\ 9
```

If you are not interested in relative numbering in Insert mode, comment out these lines in `.vimrc`
```
autocmd InsertEnter * :set relativenumber
autocmd InsertLeave * :set number
```

### Code snippets
This bundle uses [Snipmate Snippets](https://github.com/honza/snipmate-snippets), so check out the [Ruby and Rails snippets definitions](https://github.com/honza/snipmate-snippets/blob/master/snippets/ruby.snippets) to speed up your coding.
